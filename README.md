# MAF

This collection of scripts can be used for inter-converting VCF and MAF files and for converting MAF fles into other formats for input into bioinformatics tools such as *dndscv*. It is used within the [Dermatlas](https://www.dermatlasproject.org) project and several related oncogenomics projects in the Adams lab at WSTI.
